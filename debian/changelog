xbomb (2.1a-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated standards version (no actual changes required).
  * Fixed an oversight on my part which resulted in the high-score files
    being left behind even after a purge (closes: #455057).
  * As a consequence of the previous fix, the package no longer owns
    /var/games/xbomb, which is now manually created in the postinst.
  * Removed the "-s" from the install command in debian/rules, so that the
    package can be built with the nostrip option (closes: #438288).
    The normal package will still have the binary stripped by dh_strip.
  * Pass "-g" to compiler so we have something worth stripping in the
    first place. :)
  * Updated min debhelper version to 4.
  * Don't ignore Makefile errors during clean.
  * Patch to man page to make it more whatis friendly.
  * Change postinst to use "chown root:games" instead of "root.games".
  * Updated FSF address in debian/copyright
  * Added proper quoting to debian/menu.
  * Made some minor adjustments to the package description in
    debian/control.
  * Added <string.h> to hi-score.c to pick up some required prototypes.

xbomb (2.1a-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Took dh_suidregister back out, since apparently there isn't going to
    be a smooth upgrade path for packages using it. (closes:#84836)
    Also made package conflict with older suidmanager, as required.
  * Made app-defaults file into a conffile, despite the fact that lintian
    (currently) complains, because policy is just about to change here.

 -- Chris Waters <xtifr@debian.org>  Mon,  5 Feb 2001 12:28:48 -0800

xbomb (2.1a-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated standards-version (again).
  * Added Build-depends.
  * Updated the description a little.
  * Finally started using dh_suidregister.  Some minor related changes.
  * Built against XF86-4 system.  Moved app-defaults file to
    /etc/X11/app-defaults, which seems to be the correct new location,
    although it is in advance of policy.
  * Did a little cleanup on postinst and postrm, added "set -e" to all.
  * /var/games/xbomb now 755 root.root instead of 775 root.games.  Only
    the (existing) contents of this directory need to be writable.
  * High-score files now purged in prerm, not postrm, so that the
    directory can be properly removed too.
  * Added a README.Debian to talk about the high-score files.
